### Contribution Guidelines

If you want to contribute, please refer to a list of [One Ring issues](https://github.com/PastorGL/OneRing/issues) first.

An issue for your most desired feature may have already been created by someone, but if it has not, you're free to create one. Do not attach any assignees, labels, projects and so on, just provide a detailed explanation of its use case and write a simple initial specification.

If you have some spare programming horsepower and just want to code something, you can select an issue labeled as 'Help Wanted', 'Wishlist' and assigned priority â€” one of 'Px' labels. There  are labels 'Okay to tackle' and 'Good first issue' that designate the complexity of an issue. Just assign it to yourself and ask for complete specification, if it doesn't exist yet.

Do not choose issues labeled as 'Caution advised' unless you become really familiar with entire One Ring codebase.

Note that One Ring has an established code style. Your contributions must firmly adhere to coding patterns we use so they don't feel alien.

Make sure your pull requests don't touch anything outside the scope of an issue, and don't add or change versions of any external dependencies. At least, discuss these topics with original authors before you contribute.

We won't accept any code that has been borrowed from any sources that aren't compatible by license. Ours is [New BSD with do no evil clause](LICENSE).

This project has no Code of Conduct and never will. You can be as sarcastic as you want but stay polite and don't troll anyone if you dont want to be trolled in return.
